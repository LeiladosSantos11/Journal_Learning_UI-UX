Notes from my learning User Interface and User Experience

UX design is a human-centred design approach that is entirely built around the journey a person takes from first engagement with the company or product, to the point at which they end engagement.

User interface (UI) design takes place almost entirely within the digital domain. It deals specifically with the visual aspect of any screen-based action a user might be taking. 


Ben Schneiderman of the University of Maryland is a leading figure in the field and has defined eight golden rules for UI design. These are:

- Strive for consistency:
Donâ€™t confuse users. Use identical terminology, consistent colour, layout, capitalisation and fonts.
- Seek universal usability:
Recognise the needs of diverse users from novice to expert, people with disabilities, and people of any cultural background.
- Offer informative feedback:
For every user action, there should be an interface feedback. The user should know where they are in a process and what is going on at all times.
- Design dialogues to yield closure:
Organise sequences of actions into groups with a beginning, middle and end in order to give users a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. More importantly, tell users what their action has led them to.
- Prevent errors:
Users should not be able to make serious mistakes and any small mistakes should be isolated and fixable.
- Permit easy reversal of actions:
The user should be able to undo any action that they take.
- Keep users in control:
Users should be able to rely on the interface to respond to their commands in a predictable way, without any surprises or variations in behaviour.
- Reduce short term memory load:
Users should not need to remember information as they traverse displays.
